  /*
   a.	 Fields required to generate the stimulus are declared in the transaction class
   b.Transaction class can also be used as a placeholder for the activity monitored by the monitor on DUT signals

1.the first step is to declare the Fieldsâ€˜ in the transaction class
2. To generate the random stimulus, declare the fields as rand.
